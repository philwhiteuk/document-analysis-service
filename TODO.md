## 000 - Project setup and architecture planning

**User Story**: As a developer, I want a clear project structure and technology choices so that I can build a maintainable full-stack application.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Choose appropriate technology stack for frontend and backend
- Define project folder structure
- Set up basic project files and configuration
- Plan API endpoints and data flow
- Consider file storage strategy (local filesystem vs database)

**Technical Notes**:

- Must support Docker deployment
- No authentication required
- Lightweight database acceptable (SQLite, Postgres, or in-memory)
- Should handle .txt file uploads

## 001a - Backend API foundation and file upload endpoint

**User Story**: As a user, I want to upload a .txt file through an API so that it can be analyzed for text metrics.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Create a web server with file upload endpoint
- Accept only .txt files with appropriate validation
- Handle file upload errors gracefully
- Store uploaded files securely
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
- Support CORS for frontend integration

**Technical Notes**:

- Endpoint should accept multipart/form-data
- File size limits should be reasonable
- Consider temporary vs permanent file storage

## 001b - Frontend application foundation and upload UI

**User Story**: As a user, I want a web interface to upload my text file so that I can easily analyze it without using command-line tools.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Create a responsive web interface
- Implement file upload form or drag-and-drop functionality
- Show upload progress indicator
- Display success/failure states clearly
- Validate file type (.txt only) on frontend
- Handle upload errors with user-friendly messages

**Technical Notes**:

- Should work in modern browsers
- Consider accessibility requirements
- Mobile-friendly design preferred

## 002 - Text metrics computation engine

**User Story**: As a user, I want my uploaded text file to be analyzed for various metrics so that I can understand its characteristics.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Implement at least 3 of the following metrics:
  - Total word count
  - Unique word count
  - Average sentence length
  - Fleschâ€“Kincaid readability score
  - Top 10 most frequent words (excluding stopwords)
- Handle edge cases (empty files, malformed text)
- Optimize for reasonable performance
- Format results as structured data for API response

**Technical Notes**:

- Consider using established libraries for readability scoring
- Implement proper stopword filtering
- Handle various text encodings
- Results should include metric name, value, and relevant references where applicable

## 003 - Database schema and data persistence layer

**User Story**: As a system, I need to store file analysis results and metadata so that users can access their history and the system can track processed files.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Design database schema for files and analysis results
- Implement database connection and basic CRUD operations
- Store file metadata (name, upload date, size)
- Store computed metrics in structured format
- Handle database errors gracefully
- Provide database migration/initialization scripts

**Technical Notes**:

- Support SQLite for simplicity or Postgres for robustness
- Consider indexing for query performance
- Schema should support JSON storage for flexible metrics

## 004a - Results API endpoint and JSON response formatting

**User Story**: As a frontend application, I need to retrieve analysis results via API so that I can display them to the user.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Create endpoint to retrieve analysis results by file ID
- Format response as clean JSON with metric names, values, and references
- Handle cases where analysis is not yet complete
- Include file metadata in response
- Support error cases (file not found, analysis failed)

**Technical Notes**:

- Consider pagination for large result sets
- Response should be easily consumable by frontend
- Include proper HTTP status codes

## 004b - Results presentation UI with metrics display

**User Story**: As a user, I want to see my text analysis results in a clear, readable format so that I can understand my text's characteristics.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Display metrics in a clear list or table format
- Show "top 10 words" as a bar chart or organized list
- Handle loading states while fetching results
- Display file information (name, upload date)
- Format numbers appropriately (decimals, percentages)
- Handle error states gracefully

**Technical Notes**:

- Consider using a charting library for word frequency visualization
- Results should be easy to scan and understand
- Mobile-friendly layout

## 005 - History functionality (backend and frontend)

**User Story**: As a user, I want to see a history of all files I've previously analyzed so that I can compare results and re-access past analyses.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Backend: Create endpoint to list all analyzed files with basic metrics
- Frontend: Display history as a list or table
- Show file name, upload date, and key metrics for each entry
- Allow clicking on history items to view full results
- Handle empty history state
- Sort by most recent first

**Technical Notes**:

- Consider pagination for users with many files
- History should persist across browser sessions
- Include basic search/filter capabilities if time permits

## 006 - Docker containerization and deployment configuration

**User Story**: As a developer/evaluator, I want to run the entire application with a simple Docker command so that I can easily test and deploy it.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Create Dockerfile(s) for the application components
- Create docker-compose.yml for easy orchestration
- Ensure database initialization works in Docker
- Configure proper networking between services
- Handle file persistence in containerized environment
- Expose appropriate ports for access

**Technical Notes**:

- Should work with `docker-compose up`
- Consider volume mounts for data persistence
- Environment variables for configuration
- Multi-stage builds for optimization if needed

## 007 - Documentation and README

**User Story**: As a developer/evaluator, I want clear documentation so that I can understand, run, and evaluate the application.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Create comprehensive README.md with:
  - How to build and run with Docker
  - Required environment variables
  - API endpoint documentation
  - Example curl commands for testing
  - Architecture overview
- Include future enhancement ideas for a week-long implementation
- Document technology choices and trade-offs
- Include time spent and AI tool usage notes

**Technical Notes**:

- Documentation should be clear for someone unfamiliar with the codebase
- Include troubleshooting section if common issues exist

## 008 - Testing and validation

**User Story**: As a developer, I want to ensure the application works correctly so that it meets the requirements and handles edge cases.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Test file upload with various file types and sizes
- Validate all metrics calculations with known inputs
- Test error handling (invalid files, server errors)
- Verify Docker deployment works from scratch
- Test history functionality with multiple files
- Validate API responses match expected format

**Technical Notes**:

- Manual testing acceptable given time constraints
- Focus on happy path and major error cases
- Document any known limitations or bugs
